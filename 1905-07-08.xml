                <p>Tokio, July 7. </p>
                <p>The Emperor, in his address to the pleni- potentiaries, says that “if in
                    consequence of the conciliatory spirit of our opponent, hostiliiies could be
                    ended, nothing would be more satisfactory.” He instructs them to use every

                <p>It is rumoured here that the “Potemkin” has been blown up at Theodosia. (

                <p>Titzoposia, July 7. </p>
                <p>The report that the “Potemkin” has been blown up is baseless. </p>
                <p>The officials went on board and found that a committee of seven is in command,
                    and that the crew numbers 760. </p>
                <p>The latest report is that she has put to sea after a British collier.</p>
                <p>The Russian torpedo-boat “Syetlivi,” manned by officers, arrived after the
                    “Potemkin” had left. She coaled and left to continue the pursuit. ( Reuter.)</p>

                <p>The French papers state that divers raised the submarine which sunk at Bizerta in
                    40 feet of water, and found the crew alive. The officials are silent. (
                    Reuter.)</p>
                <p>Paris, July 7, </p>
                <p>The fate of the crew of the submarine is still uncertain. ( Heuter.)</p>
                <p>Paris, July 7. </p>
                <p>M. Thomson, Minister of Marine, has left for Bizerta. The attempts to refloat the
                    submarine “Farfadet” continue. Fears are entertained for the safety of the crew.

                <p>An AxiomM.—In a cosmopolitan country like Egypt it is very useful to kwiow
                    several lan- guages. ‘'hat goes without saying. But for commercial men this
                    truth is an axiom. And as the “Eg¥ptian Gazette” truly said: “In Egypt the
                    commercial traveller must be a linguist and something of a diplomat.” Now, if it
                    is sometimes difficult to acquire this last quality, it ison the other hand very
                    easy to learn a foreign language in a short time, thanks to the Berlitz Schools,
                    of Cairo and of Alex- andria. [Advt.]</p>

                <p>An AxtoM.—In a cosmopolitan country like Egypt it is very useful to know several

                    axiom. And as the “Eg¥ptian Gazette” truly said: “In Egypt the commercial
                    traveller must be a linguist and something of a diplomat.” Now, if it is
                    sometimes difficult to acquire this last quality, it ison the other hand very
                    easy to learn a foreign language in a short time, thanks to the Berlitz Schools,

                <p>ee</p>
                <p>Dear Sir,—Asa resident of Ghezireh it has | occurred to me that with the
                    assistance of others &amp; campaign may well be started against the mosquitoes
                    with the idea of reducing their numbers, as they are at present a pest. I
                    have</p>
                <p>tried all kinds of preparations, such as mos-</p>
                <p>quito terrors and othef8, and I find that al- though my acquaintances are
                    inclined to avoid me in consequenéé, the mosquitoes are mote’ attentive than
                    ever. There are many gentle- men in Government positions with nothing to do—I
                    beg their pardon, I mean with spare</p>
                <p>“</p>
                <p> </p>
                <p>came together they could agree tothe forma- |</p>
                <p> </p>
                <p>of reptiles and flies and mosquitoes. ‘I'he corps might be called the G. A.M. B.
                    (Ghezireh Anti- | Mosquito Brigade) and it would not take long | to appoint a
                    commandant and a permanent | staff. Although I should object to ladies in</p>
                <p>‘administrative appointments, there is no reason</p>
                <p>why they should not join the rank and file, provided they are medically fit and
                    active. Of | course at present there is no necessity for a band or @ distinctive
                    uniform, but that would no doubt come in time. As a temporary measure oil might
                    be obtained from the street lamps, but if the corps got popular, recruits on
                    join- ing might provide themselves with bottles of paraffio, and tlie large
                    hotels and officers on promotion might present it by the barrel. My proposal is
                    to attract the mosquitoes with some of the numerous anti-mosquito solutions laid
                    down in soup plates,and once having got t) destroy them with paraffin oil. [</p>
                <p>'The extermination of these insects would be a boon to the inhabitants of

                    recompense there is still the pos-</p>

                <p>paid by this institution, have in a way attracted the attention of a few of the
                    English insur- ance companies, yet, strange as it may seem, considering the
                    excellent security offered, we</p>
                <p>‘are given to understand that there is still</p>
                <p>much difficulty encountered in attempting to obtain loans in England on the
                    ‘secürity of real property in this country, notwith- standing that the advance
                    asked is generally on the best lands at half the estimated value. Another fact
                    that strikes one is that the local institutions that have been doing for years a
                    lucrative business in this line, foremost amongst which is the Credit Foncier,
                    have made very few bad debts, the losses being so small that they are scarcely
                    con- sidered as worth mentioning in the annual reports. ‘The erection of
                    palatial new premises by the latter institution ata cost of a million francs is
                    another and a #uflicient proof of the excellence of this description of
                    business. With such facts staring usin the face, we repeat it is passing strange
                    that financiers and others in the United Kingdom should still hesitate’to lend
                    money on real property in ‘this country, where land has been for the Igst.ten
                    years or so rapidly increasing in value, and i8 still doing so. As a general
                    rule invest- ments in that class of security are, we should say, quite as safe
                    as those in Unified or Domains Loans. '</p>

                    invested in Consols, prodace the same-inecome as the ground-rent. The bidding
                    started at £2,000 perannum ground-rent and ran up to £3,000 per annum, at which
                    it was knocked down to a client of Mr. M. E. Collins, the architect. This works
                    out at about £67 10s. per square foot, and, if the purchaser exercises his
                    option to purchase the necessary Consols, at present ptice they will cost abont
                    £108,000.</p>

                <p>A Fayoulm correspondent writes :— On Mon- day last, as the ‘Tamish train was
                    about to leave the Fayoum station, it was derailed.. One or two of the coaches
                    were much damaged by being in contact with the irop pillars which support the
                    iron station roof, some of them baing displaced. The passengers fortunate'y got
                    off with a severe shaking. Again, on Thars- day the Shawashna train, due at
                    Fayoum at 3 p.m., arrived at 4.45 p.m., nearly two hours late, and tomake
                    matters worse it was also derailed and caused considerable damage to the lines
                    before the engine could be stopped. We unfortunate travellers arrived back at
                    Shawashna at 10 p.m. This certainly gives you plenty~f6r your money, but ofa
                    kind not valued, and itis really astonishing how many people now take a donkey
                    when they wish to catch the Cairo connection.</p>

                <p>hn VII. :</p>
                <p>I put myself in charge of the station-master as soon asl arrived at Ma’an and
                    rashed into the station building amid clouds of dust blown by a hurricane. As
                    soon as the train had steamed off toa siding and all the work con- nected with
                    its arrival had been done, the guards, porters, brakesmen, etc., trooped into
                    the station cursing, swearing, and wiping their eyes. They explained that there
                    always was dust and sand at Ma’4n but that “never in the memory-of the
                    oldest*inhabitant, etc.,” had a storm come up so suddenly as this. Then the
                    station-master interposed ; he had had much experience of railways in the
                    Ottoman Empire, he had been on the Smyrna line and on the Anatolian, and he had
                    been two years at Ma’in. Who could know more about the wind at Ma’in than
                    himself, who had grown grey- haired from work and discomfort in the last
                    eighteen months? The wind was often a thousand times worse !</p>
                <p>The weather was then dropped’ and the visitor came up for cross-examination. I
                    survived the ordeal and had a good deal of conversation with the station-master
                    and his assistants, who were all curiously thickly clad, wearing high boots,
                    neckcloths, and woollen</p>
                <p>| jerseys in spite of a temperature of close</p>
                <p>907°</p>
                <p>The village of Ma’an is some forty minutes by mule from the station and contains
                    nothing of interest except the ruins of an old wall. Its inhabitants lived by
                    smuggling and gun- running till recently and are now driven to live by pilfering
                    or doing any work they can find on the line, their old trades being more
                    dangerous though still very Incrative. Like their kinsmen at Wadi Musa (Petra)
                    they have a bad name for insolencé and rapacity, and those who keep goats or
                    fowls charge the Turkish troops the most exorbitant prices for niilk or eggs.
                    The Kaimakam is said to be rather heavy-handed but no doubt they deserve it. The
                    picturesque Bedouin of romance is utterly despised by every Turk or Circassian,
                    and when you see the races together, you understand why the Nor- therner nearly
                    always wins—when he can tackle his opponent. The Yemen affair,be it re-
                    membered, is not a war of Turks and Be- douins. The Arabs of South Arabia are
                    town and village dwellers, agriculturalists and traders, descended. from the
                    Sabeans and Mineans, who w great and - civilised in King Solomon’s days; no
                    doubt there are plenty of Bedouing on their side, but the settled Arabs are thé
                    core of the re volt, -just asin the Sudan, when the success of the Mahdi was
                    assured by the defection of the riverain Arabs from the Egyptian Govern-
                    ment.</p>
                <p>I got very little information at Ma’an of either the war in the Yemen or the
                    progress of the railway. Beyond Ma’in the rails have been laid for perhaps 5 or
                    6 miles, the embank- ments for 30, and the surveys ot the route have been pushed
                    some 60 miles more to theysouth. At Batn el Ghoul (The Devil’s Belly) south of
                    Ma’an there is said to be good water and the,air is so magnificent that Mr.
                    Meissner dreams of a sanatorium that will vie with Helouan and Biskra.”</p>
                <p>Ma’én on the other hand is badly off for drinking water, which comes from
                    Katranéh in iron tanks by--traia. The wells supply water, which is good enough
                    for the engines,</p>
                <p>on</p>
                <p>but when drunk -by homan beings often.</p>
                <p>produces unpleasant effects.</p>
                <p>At about 4p.m. the winddropped a little and 1 went out fora walk. The camp and
                    the neighbourhood of the railway were disgust- ingly filthy There was no
                    sanitation whatever, and during the two or three years in which troops had been
                    posted there, nothing seemed to have been done to keep the camp clean. The
                    dryness of the air and the fact that no one drank the Ma’An water alone
                    prevented an epidemic. The dispersed groups of tents which made up the camp were
                    pitched on sandy places where the ~stones had been~ removed for ballasting the
                    line and the dust and sand that blew about were impregnated with cor-</p>
                <p>ruption. North of the camp wasa low rounded</p>
                <p>ridge. covered with dark grey stones. Some miles to the south a long escarpment
                    of lime- stone rock, shaped like the Jebel Hoft at Helouan rose from the plain
                    and ran from S.E. to N. W. The view on the west was shut in by numerous low
                    kopjes but beyond them I could distinguish a high range of lifeless black hills,
                    beyond which lay the Akaba depression. On the east was a perfect and abso- lute
                    blank. The blf&amp;ck desert spread like a sea, unbroken and unrelieved except
                    by the peak that may—or may not—have been Ras el Tobeit.</p>
                <p>It was so extraordinarily lonely and desolate that I felt sure that it would one
                    day be ‘developed’ by some of those ingenious persons who, on finding a region
                    unsuited to animal or vegetable life, jump to the conclusion that it abounds,
