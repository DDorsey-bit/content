                    <head>THE RISING SUN.</head>
                    <p>Now that the war in the East is running to its close, we are finding time to
                        think about it. The victories of Japan, and the successes of this nation in
                        peace and war, have disturbed our conception of things. We have to revise
                        our outlook on the world, and readjust our angle of vision. Ideas which have
                        been traditional for centuries have been rudely shaken. It is long indeed
                        since the nations of the Teutonic and Celtio and Latin stocks have had even
                        to admit the possibility of rivalry on this planet. We were free to quarrel
                        among ourselves, secure in the conviction that the "inferior races" could
                        play no more than the part of interested spectators. That they should take a
                        hand in the game seemed almost as unnatural as it must have been to Gulliver
                        when he reached a land where the men drew the carriages and the horses sat
                        inside.</p>
                    <p>For centuries the East has been falling back before the West. Civilisation,
                        in our haughty conception, has had a special and limited meaning, Even
                        Stubbs, that catholic and comprehensive historian, thought that the only
                        peoples whose annals were really worth studying, were those corthern races
                        which had grafted the ethics of Christianity on the culture of Greece and
                        the jurisprudence of Rome. That, until the other day, was the orthodox
                        theory of human progress. Liberty, law, education, discovery, all the things
                        of which we are proud, are supposed to trace back<cb n="6"/> ultimately to
                        the union above mentioned. Without them there could be no true civilisa-:
                        tion; only a certain mechanical proficiency in material arts, like the
                        decorative work of the Arabs, or some mere fighting instinct, such as that
                        of the Turks or the Mongols. In war or peace the East could never be more
                        than second best, childish, barbario.</p>
                    <p>But the events of the past fourteen months give us pause, Here we have to do
                        with a people which has not and never has been, Christianised, Romanised, or
                        Hellenised, and which, apparently, has in its veins no single drop of the
                        white man's blood. And this people has only to set itself to the business to
                        show that in most of the things which we regard as the peculiar products of
                        our European civilisation, it is equal to the best of us. We have grown up
                        in the belief that in this rather vital. matter of warfare no Asiatic or
                        Oriental race could really hold its own with Europeans. We know now that
                        this axiom requires to be modified. But the Japanese have clearly other
                        qualities besides those of the soldier. Does civilisation mean a high
                        intellectual culture, the deepest feeling for art and beauty, the gilt
                        of-organisation, the love of order, decorum, discipline, and justice? All
                        these qualities and aptitudes the Japanese seem to possess, It was startling
                        for our critics to find that these distant islands had mastered the secrets
                        of colour and workmanship. The show of Japanese objects at the first French
                        Exhibition left upon our artists an impression which is not likely to be
                        effaced. If there had been no Japan there would have been no Whistler.</p>
                    <p>It is, however, on the ethical side that this revelation from the Far East is
                        most striking. We of Europe and America have always been able to comtort
                        ourselves with the. thought that morality, in its highest sense, was our own
                        especial prerogative. It is the white man's privilege. Yet we are confronted
                        with a non- Christian Eastern people, which is not only brave, but orderly,
                        temperate, generous and humane; which is said to have carried selfcontrol
                        and self-restraint to a pitch beyond the reckoning of our philosophers and
                        divines; and has developed the loftiest code of honor, patriotism, and
                        devotion to duty. We cherish the memory of a single hero, here and there,
                        like that Switzer of Sempach, who gathered the points of the hostile spears
                        into his breast to make an opening for his comrades. But whole battalions of
                        the common men of Nippon act like that. In the trenches before Port Arthur a
                        Japanese colonel calmly gave the command: "The honorable front rank will
                        throw itself on the enemy's bayonets." The honorable front rank instantly
                        obeyed. They flung themselves upon the spikes, and made a causeway with
                        their writhing bodies, over which their companions marched. A regiment of
                        Arnolds von Winkelried! And those who thus outrival the self-immolation of
                        the warrior ants and the Ghazis are not soulless or mindless machines, but
                        men of intelligence and sensibility. There must be a good many persons who
                        are asking themselves whether the ethical system which has produced such
                        extraordinary results is not worth study. The Russians believe in their
                        faith as no other Christian people do, unless it be the Spaniards. And if we
                        look at the recent history of Russia and Spain on the one side, and then at
                        Japan on the other, the result is a little disturbing. We remember that at
                        the beginning of the New Era the Mikado sent a commission of statesmen to
                        study the institutions of Europe and America. The commissioners recommended
                        an adaptation of the British Navy, Prussian finance, American education, and
                        so on; but they reported that no reproduction of our religious or ethical
                        systems was worth considering. In these matters Japan had nothing to learn
                        from the West. Perhaps she may have something to teach..</p>

                    <p>In another column of to-day's issue we publish the report of the directors of
                        the Egyptian Markets, Limited, for the past year. Although the results of
                        the year's trading may be considered somewhat disappointing, owing to the
                        fact that all the cattle markets have been closed during the year to horned
                        cattle, still we think the shareholders will appreciate, the efforts of
                        their directors under such trying circumstances. Not only have their efforts
                        to decrease working expenses been so far successful, butthey have also given
                        up over £1,500 of their fees, thus making a total revenue for the year of
                        £18,580. Further, the shareholders are to be congratulated on the extension
                        of the concession for a further term of ten years. All things considered,
                        the Egyptian Markets should now have weathered the storm, and be entering on
                        a period of prosperity.</p>

                    <head>IS THE ASSOUAN DAM SAFE ?</head>
                    <p>A PLEA FOR OBSERVATION AND DELAY.</p>
                    <p>THE NILE DAM AND ITS TASK.</p>
                    <p>The question of raising the Nile dam at Assouan is keenly exercising the
                        professional mind. Engineers, more especially those who have had experience
                        of large water schemes, are divided as to whether or not the present barrage
                        ought to be taxed with extra work, and it is reassuring to find a voice
                        raised here and there on the side of prudence and delay. We have interviewed
                        Mr. Ewing Matheson, a wellknown member of the Institute of Civil Engineers,
                        and while expressing confidence in the united experience of the chief
                        experts in this branch. of the profession-men like Messrs. Mansergh,
                        Hawksley, and Bateman-he said Sir Benjamin Baker would be well advised to
                        lengthen the period of observations before the present structure of the dam
                        was added to in any way.</p>
                    <p>"The Nile dam," said Mr. Matheson to our representative, "was no doubt
                        designed for its present height of water, with a margin of safety, and to
                        raise it to a considerable height means reviving the old question of
                        flooding the island of Phila over again, and matters of public safety that
                        are much more important. It is impossible to foretell or conceive the damage
                        which would be done if the dam were overtaxed."</p>
                    <p>Mr. Matheson cited the disastrous floods at Sheffield and Johnstown,
                        Pennsylvania, as instances of insufficient planning. "I visited Johnstown,"
                        he said, "twelve months after the catastrophe, and saw traces even then of
                        that terrible flood. Fifteen miles away from the scene of the burst, there
                        were locomotives swept aside and overturned, and it was all due to
                        insufficient calculation, added to the usual light-heartedness of the
                        Americans in their constructive undertakings.</p>

                    <head>THE FACTORS OF DESTRUCTION.</head>
                    <p>The two main considerations in the proper working of a dam of this kind are
                        the rush of water and the height-the 'height' being a teclinical expression
                        for the hydrostatic pressure. It is the rush of water which creates what we
                        call the scour, or attrition along the conduits or subterranean passages;
                        and it was with a view to preserve them that, in the Assouan case, they were
                        paved for a certain portion. Sir Benjamin Baker's recent visit was to report
                        on the working out of these calculations, and as a result this pavement is
                        to be extended. But it will be a matter for the most anxious consideration
                        before the dam is raised, as projected, merely to increase the area of
                        irrigation purposes. Far better wait another year or two, and estimate wear
                        and tear upon the present construction."</p>
                    <p>"Are there any precedents!" we asked. "Yes, of one kind or another," was the
                        reply, "and the experience in this class of work among British engineers all
                        over the world, as well as in work under British supervision, fortifies us
                        against any novel theories or experiments. There have been just sufficient
                        failures to bring them up to the mark, and in the construction of nasonry
                        dams no possible precaution is now neglected, even where, as in the case of
                        the present construction at Leeds, the volume of water is not to be compared
                        with that of the Nile.</p>

                <div type="item">
                    <p>THE OVERWHELMING RISKS. "Everything, depends upon the margin of safety as
                        allowed originally. It must have entered into the minds of the designers
                        that the dam might be raised or thickened later on; and it remained then to
                        see that the dovetailing of the rock foundations were sufficient for any
                        increase in superincumbent weight. Personally, I should advise waiting for
                        another year or two, as I have said, botore considering additions involving
                        perhaps 6lbs. extra pressure to the square inch of surface. The advantages
                        to be gained are dwarfed into insignificance compared with the awful extent
                        of the danger incurred."-"Pall Mall Gazette.")</p>

                        Governor, several of the consuls, headed by the French Consul, etc.</p>
                    <p>The service was of the most impressive character, and the large congregation,
                        it could be seen, was deeply affected. The splendid Miseremini mei
                        especially was rendered with supreme pathos. At the close of the requiem,
                        the celebrant, attended by his clergy, left the altar preceded by the
                        crucifix and acolytes, and went towards the catafalque for the absolution,
                        the time the Christian Brothers sang Libera me.</p>
                    <p>This ceremony over the Archbishop went to St. Mark's chapel, where the mortal
                        remains of the late Archbishop Bonfigli are laid, and where a monument to
                        his memory has been erected. Mr. Moriondo, president of the memorial
                        committee, here address" ed the Archbishop in Italian, handing over the
                        memorial to his lordship's care. Archbishop Briante replied, thanking the
                        committee for their beautiful gift to the church, which would always receive
                        the most tender and reverent</p>
                    <p>care.</p>
                    <p>The parchment containing a record of the ceremony and the names of the clergy
                        connected with the church, was then signed by the consuls present and read
                        by the Pro-Vicar General Amadio Amato, to whose initiative and untiring
                        efforts the erection of the monument is mainly due, and who deserves the
                        thanks of the Catholic community.</p>

                    <p>The fire which caused the destruction of the Abbas Helmy Theatre is generally
                        believed to have been due to the same cause as the other recent great
                        conflagration in the Old Bourse Palace, namely, the fusing of an electric
                        wire. The scene of the fire still attracts large numbers of spectators, but
                        no idea can be obtained of the ruin brought by the fire from an external
                        inspection, as the walls of the building are intact. It is only on entering
                        what was the auditorium that one is able to grasp the extent of the
                        devastating work of the flames. The theatre is absolutely burnt out except
                        the walls. The force of the fire is evidenced by the state of the iron
                        pillars which used to support the boxes. They are nearly all cracked by the
                        fierceness of the heat.</p>
                    <p>The only thing left untouched by the fire and unspoilt by the water was a
                        large portraitof the actress Bellincioni in the entrance hall. In every
                        other respect the theatre is an abomination of desolation."</p>

                    <head>THE COLLAPSE IN THE ATTARIN</head>
                    <p>The collapse of a house in the Attarin quarter of Alexandria on Wednesday was
                        not, luckily, attended with any loss of life. The collapse was due to a
                        neighbour excavating by the side of the house in order to make the
                        foundations of a new building. This man texcavated to a depth of at least
                        two and a half metres underneath the foundations of the house. The result
                        was that the house collapsed entirely and two persons were buried in the
                        ruins. One of them was buried under some metres of rubbish and stones and it
                        was ten. minutes before the Fire Brigade managed to get down to him. They
                        bared his head and gave him first-aid, feeding him on whisky and caffeine.
                        It took another full hour to liberate his body, which was severely
                        braised.</p>
                    <p>A somewhat humorous incident took place when the Fire Brigade had cleared
                        away the earth from the man's head. He was a native Moslem and refused to
                        take the caffeine (Shorbah Ahmar) but asked "Mafish Whisky 1" The
                        Superintendent of the Fire Brigade at once sent a shawish of the police to
                        buy a tumbler of whisky and the contents were poured down the man's mouth,
                        greatly to his relish. He only remarked, "All right, work away," for his
                        arms and entire body were still pinned by the earth. Soon afterwards he was
                        again offered caffeine but refused it, and asked for more whisky, and by the
                        time his body had been extricated, which operation had taken an hour and a
                        quarter, he had consumed a full bottle of whisky. When the stretcher on
                        which he lay was being raised to take him to the bospital he asked whether
                        he could have any more!</p>

                    <head>EGYPTIAN MARKETS.</head>
                    <p>REPORT FOR THE YEAR.</p>
                    <p>The directors of the company in their report for the year ended 31st
                        December, 1904 state that for the whole of the year all the markets have, by
                        order of the Government, been closed to horned cattle in consequence of the
                        cattle plague. The gross receipts of the company for the year were:-trom
                        cattle marketa, £16,104; general markets £9,138; abattoirs, £923, total,
                        £26,165, which, together with sundry receipts, makes a grand total of
                        £26,602. This gives an average per market per week of £214s. 7d. for cattle
                        markets (including abattoirs), and of £1 9s. 3d. for general markets. Total
                        £4 38. 10d. Consi derable further economies have been effected during the
                        year in the working of the marketa. the total cost of which has been reduced
                        to £16,035, or £4,537 less than in 1903. In consideration of the heavy
                        losses sustained by the company by the closing of the cattle markets, the
                        directors have agreed to forego their fees for the year under review to the
                        extent of £1,525. The trustees for the debenture holders, the Hon. Alfred
                        Lyttelton and Arthur Wagg, Esq., have also agreed to forego their fees to a
                        corresponding extent.</p>
                    <p>The directors are gratified to report that the Egyptian Government was in
                        1904 pleased to grant a ten years' extension of the concession, as some
                        compensation for the losses sustained by the company in consequence of the
                        closing of the markets. In consequence of the extension of the Government
                        concession, a revision of the sinking fand for the redemption of the share
                        capital has been effected, which in fature years will result in a saving to
                        the company of £1,193 per annum, with effect from the 17th Novem ber, 1904.
                        Under the old arrangement the interest per annum upon the debentures of the
                        company and the share capital sinking fund premium combined amounted to
                        £7,444. Under the revised arrangement they will amount to £6,251, effecting
                        a saving per annum of £1,193. After meeting charges for administration and
                        working, the net revenue for the year from all sources amounts to £10,567
                        0s. 6d. which, together with the balance of £8,015 4s. 11d. brought forward
                        from 1903, makes a total of £18,582 58. 5d. to be dealt with. After payment
                        of the annual premium for the amortisation of share and debenture capital,
                        £5,028 28. 7d., and debenture interest, £4,459 11s. 8d., a balance of £9,094
                        118. 2d. remains for disposal. Having given the matter their most careful
                        consideration, the directors have decided, in view of the fact that the best
                        season of 1905 has already been lost, not to recommend the payment of a
                        dividend until the re-opening of the cattle markets has been authorised by
                        the Government. The abattoirs continue to show satisfactory and progressive
                        results. The company's share of the net earnings from this source amounted
                        to £922 12s. 5d. The total number now opened is fifteen and Government
                        proposes to build others during 1905, of which five are under
                        construction.</p>
                    <p>As in the previous year, the directors and staff have done everything in
                        their power to assist the efforts of Government during the year 1904 to
                        entirely eradicate the cattle plague from Egypt. The recognition by Govern-
                        ment, in the extension of the concession, of the losses sustained by the
                        conpany, is fully appreciated, but the directors, in view of the length of
                        time the markets have been closed, still hope that further considerations
                        will be granted. The directors wish to draw the attention of the proprietors
                        to the fact that, notwithstanding the serious losses incurred by the closing
                        of the markets, it has been possible, by the utmost economy and by
                        abandoning their fees and those of the trustees, to meet all working and
                        other expenses. A good deal has been done in the way of negotiations towards
                        sub-letting the markets, but it is not considered opportune to press the
                        conclusion of contracts until the cattle markets are reopened. The directors
                        report the resignation of Lieut.-Col. E.L. Marryat, R.E, from the Board.
                        Major W.I. Le Breton has been elected in his place In accordance with the
                        articles of association, two directors of the company, Major W.I. Le Breton
                        and Mr. W. O. Joseph, retire at this meeting and, being eligible, offer
                        themselves for re-election..</p>

                    <head>THE SUCRERIES COMPANY.</head>
                    <p>In our issue of the 4th inst., we stated that the Sucreries Company had
                        decided to pay a dividend of 13% for the year 1903-4, i.e., 5% already paid
                        as interim dividend and 8% after the general meeting of 12th inst. Our Cairo
                        Correspondent writes to rectify this information. It appears from his
                        interview with one of the directors of the company that the board intends to
                        propose to the next general meeting a dividend of 8%, of which 5% was paid
                        on October 81 last. The balance to be distributed on April 30 will thus be
                        3%, if, as is likely, the shareholders adopt the proposition of their
                        board.</p>
                    <p>It is to be noted that the financial year 1903-</p>
                    <p>4 was closed before the present rise in the price of sugar, and that it had
                        to defray the exceptional expenditure arising from the taking over by this
                        company of the old Daïra sugar factories. The current year will therefore
                        reap' the profit from the rise in sugar and the increase in the production
                        consequent on the purchase of the Daïra factories.</p>

                        sanitary danger, viz., the presence of dogs in the first-class carriages on
                        the Pont Limoun-Marg railway,-dogs, moreover, not merely lying on the floor,
                        but reposing on the seats. Even a clean and healthy dog is objec tionable in
                        a railway carriage; how much more so are dogs, dirty, mangy, and densely
                        popula ted, such as are constantly seen on the line in question?</p>
                    <p>In any civilised country this would not be allowed, as there, the health and
                        comfort of the passengers are the first consideration of the Railway
                        authorities, which does not seem to be the case on this particular branch of
                        the Egyptian State Railways. I feel sure, however, that this matter has only
                        to be brought to the notice of the responsible Railway officials for them to
                        take the necessary steps to put a stop to this reprehensible practice.</p>

                        great cataract near Beled known .ally as "Sadd Nimrud," or Nimrod's dam.
                        'file Nahrwan and Dijail canals look out from above these weire^ .The
                        Nahrwan canal was ruined by the Tigris changing its course, and the
                        undermining and sweeping away of these great cataracts sealed the ruin of
                        all the irrigation systems fed by the Tigris. From Beled to Bagdad the
                        Tigris has a length of about 110 kilometres, and a width of from 4
                        kilometres to 350 'metres. Where the river is wide, it flows over a bed of
                        shingle and has a velocity pf some 6 to 7 kilometres per hour. Navigation by
                        sailing boats is impossible against the current.</p>
                    <p>From Bagdad to Gurnn,whore tho Tigris and Euphrates meet, the river has a
                        length of 740 kilometres. The distance from Gnrna to Basra is 60 kilometres,
                        and 100 kilometres further on is the Persian Gulf. Tho distances along the
                        Tigris are therefore as follows . . ' From Beled to tho Sea J 1010

                        <p>To rta Editor of the Egyptian Gazette. Sir,—In reply to "Grammarian's"
                            lette.r in yesterday's "Gazette," I hive to inform him:— .(1) Not long
                            before reviewing Dirr's Arabic Grammar, the "Gazette" published my
                            opinion of another grammar of the classical language, which was most
                            flattering and which was afterwards shared by the editor of a well-known
                            literary Arabic periodical inJJairo in his review of it (2) ' Before
                            sending in mf artiole on Dirr's grammar I gave the book to a native
                            friend (who is a competent Arabio scholar) to read and return to me with
                            his opinion. He brought it after a few days and told me what he thought
                            of it in fewer but severer words than I used. I then gave him my article
                            to read and he approved of every word I said. Moreover, I have not yet
                            met one who knew the book and did not share my opinion of it (3) Since
                            sending my article to the "Gazette" 1 have learned that the book had
                            been sent to an Euglish gentleman who is a well- known Arabic scholar,
                            but although he refused to review it he marked here and there what he
                            considered flagrant errors. The reason of his refusal is therefore not
                            far to seek. . (4) I confirm every word I said in my review, but I
                            cannot enter into any discussion with one who makes the ridioulous
                            statement that it is grammatically correct to say el ingi- lyz tayiba
                            because he means the English as a nation, and pretends that most of the
                            other mistakes are obvious slips. (5) "Grammariau" has the fault of more
                            than one other resident in the country who no sooner- picks up? a few
                            words of Arabio (and before he could write a sentence correctly without
                            the aid of some one else) than be rushes.to the press with a wonderful
                            grammar of his own. It would have been better for "Grammarian" to study
                            the language for many more years before venturing to write a book
                            dealing with it (6) "Grammarian'' will have to get all the , mistakes I
                            pointed out, and many more, cor- ; need before the book ceases to be
                            called a . "queer'' grammar.. As regards his personal reference to me,
                            there is no need for me to reply, as this sort of controversial method
                            is beneath contempt.— Yours very truly,</p>

                    <p>Mr. Justice Kekewich in the Chancery Divi- sion on,Tahsday w§ek continued the
                        hearing of the notion in which'Dr. Robert William Eelkin Rued the Palmerston
                        Industrial and Finance Corporation, Ltd., and Mr. Alfred -Bridge, a company
                        promoter, of-15, Cockspur-street, W., claiming rescission of an agreement to
                        take 800 shares in the Sudan Exploration, Ltd., and a declaration that
                        defendants were liable to indemnify the plaintiff in respect of all expen-
                        ses incurred by him in relation to the transac- tion, or in the alternative
                        damages for alleged misrepresentation. The corporation denied that its
                        policy or business was controlled by Bridge, and did not admit that the
                        representations alleged to have been made by him were made on behalf of the
                        corporation or with its know- ledge. The.defendant Bridge pleaded that if he
                        did. make any representations or statements concerning the present or future
                        value of the shares they were bona fide expressions of opi- nion. Defendant
                        Bridge counter-claimed againit the plaintiff for alleged misrepresentation.—
                        Mr. P. Ogden Lawrence, K. C. and Mr. J; H. Simmons appeared for plaintiff,
                        Mr. Ashton Cross for the Palmerston Corporation, and Mr. W. J. L Ambrose for
                        Mr. Bridge. Plaintiff, continuing his evidence, said that up to the issue of
                        the writ in this action he had never received a certificate for or transfer
                        of the 800 shares in the . Sudan Exploration, Ltd.</p>
                    <p>In cross-examination by Mr. Ashton Cross, for the Palmerston Corporation,
                        plaintiff said he knew the property which the Siidan Explo- ration had been
                        formed to acquire. From his knowledge of the country witness believed the
                        company's property to be valuable. Ho wa3 anxious to g|t some Sudan sbures
                        if he could pay cash for them. The 10$. nominal shares could not be obtained
                        for less than £1. Ho Btill believed in tho success of the Sudan Company if
                        it was well managed. Mr. Ashton Cross said he agreed that the Palmerston
                        Corporation sold the shares to Dr. Felkip and those shares had been
                        delivered. Plaintiff, >n auswer to counsel, said ho be- lieved that the 800
                        shares were in the Sudan Company's hands' for transfer. In cross-examination
                        by ' Mr. Ambrose, plaintiff said he understood that the Palmerston
                        Corporation was to put the shares on the mar- ket at-£2 when the
                        pooling-arrangement came to an end. He always understood that Bridge was
                        actiug for the Palmerston Corporation. This concluded plaintiff's case, and
                        Mr. Ashton Cross, submitting that ho case had been made out against the
                        corporation, called Mr. Allred Bridge, who described himself as a director
                        of. the Palmerston Corporation, of which,he said,tho plaintiff also beoamo a
                        direc- tor. When the question of the Sudan Explora- tion shares was uuder
                        discussion, plaintiff said that if he went into the matter ho should want a
                        share of the profits, and witness then told him he had better become a
                        director. Plaintiff, said witness, worked hand-in-hand with him in the Sudan
                        matter, and advised the corporation to take up the shares. Witness denied
                        that he ever made any representations to induce plaintiff to go into the
                        share transaction, and he said that Dr. Felkin must have understood the
                        whole transaction.</p>
                    <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Lawrence, witness said that he was a company promoter,
                        and prior to his going to Cockspur-street he carried on business at 8,
                        Union-court, FC., where he promoted a number of companies. May I take it
                        that, all the companies you promoted come to grief?—No.—Witness men- tioned
                        the Pan-African Syndicate, Ltd., and the London and Provincial Dairy Company
                        as suocossful promotions. Witness denied that at the time he
                        left'Union-courtoxocutions were out against him at his office and at his
                        house at Surbiton. Wore there any baukruptcy petitions presented against you
                        ?—Yes. May I tako it that altogether 8, Union-court, got too hot for yon at
                        tho time you migrated to the West End ?—No, not at all.—Witness said he
                        sometimes advertised for directors willing to invest It was not true to
                        suggest that witness was the Palmerston Corporation. He agreed that there
                        was no entry in the mi- nute-books concerning the agreement with tho
                        plaintiff. At the date of the signing of the bill by the plaintiff witness
                        admitted that the only transfer of Sudan shares to the Palmer ston
                        Corporation was one for 600 shqres. They had, however,' made arrangements to
                        acquirejurther shares.</p>

                        <p>The abovo teams met at Abbassieh xm Wednesday last. Both teams hold a
                            good record. The K.R.R's, it seems, have not been defeated since 1902,
                            whereas the representatives of the Shamrook have only been beaten onoe
                            in some sixtyodd matches,60 a good game was expected. The pitch was in
                            splendid order as the Irishmen took the field in the following order :
                            Goal, Dadgeon ; backs, Shanks and Reid ; halves, Millar, Nixon, and
                            Smyth ; forwards, Todd, Hutton, Cunningham, Fallon, and Walsh. The
                            Rifles won the spin of the coin and defended the city goals. There would
                            be almost 900 spectators present when Cunningham commenced operations..
                            The opening minutes proved sensational as the Inuiskillings bom- barded
                            the Rifles' goal for fully five minutes. The custodian clearing the
                            Rifles now broke away per Bibbleton, but Smyth robbed and returned. Todd
                            getting possession centred well but Fallon sent behind. On the kick-off
                            tho Rifles took play towards Dudgeon, but the latler was not to be
                            oanght napping and cleared in Gillispie's best style. At this stage the
                            referee (a sergeant of the K.KR.'s) had occasion to retire owing to a
                            misunderstanding of the roles, Mr. MoKenzie, Royal Engineers, filling
                            the vacanoy (amid cheers). On play being resumed Cunningham got away and
                            sent across to Todd, who outwitted two opponents and seut strongly into
                            goal, where Fallon headed over the bar. Flay remained in midfield, until
                            Fallon broke away, but when in a good position ho was! fouled by
                            Bibbleton. A fight ensued, both players being oantioned. The Rifles'
                            right wiug now got away but Smyth intercepted and returned. Some very
                            spirited play 'took place around the Rifles' goal. At last, however, the
                            custodian cleared. The Irishmen were now ' having the best of matters
                            and a shot of Cunningham's deserved a better fate. A free against the
                            Green and Buff Brigade proved unproductive. It was close on half-timo as
                            Hutton gave the Dark Greens' defence some trouble. Half-time now arrived
                            with the repre- seratives of the Shamrock pressing for all they were
                            worth,but there was no score yet on either side.</p>
                        <p>After the usual refreshments both teams took tho field. The first thing
                            noticeable was a great sprint by Todd. The ball, however, found touch.
                            The Rifles now took play in hand, but Smith robbed the right wing -time
                            after time. A corner to the Rifles looked ridrie too rosy for the Green
                            and Buff Brigade, HoWeker Nixon cleared and the InniskUliugs were seen
                            fio advantage. Walsh, however, ran the ball ovet tho liue. On the kick
                            off Bibbleton got away, on his own, but Smith was on his track aneb
                            blocked his passage once more. Not to be deniod, the Rifles got down
                            towards Dudgeon and scored, but Johnny Bibbleton was given offside. On
                            resuming, Millar got away on his own, and alter dodging a couple of
                            opponents sent across to Cunningham, who had a good try for goal. The
                            Rifles now pulled themselves togother and worked their way down towards
                            Dudgeon but Nixon and Smith were not to be beaten so easily and play was
                            once more trans- ferred, when Hutton got well away and gave to Todd, who
                            aont in a "daisy cutter" to tho Custodian, who fell on the ball but too
                            late, as Fallou gut the ball at his toe and into the net it went,
                            drawing first blood for the Innis- killings amidst deafening cheers. Oa
                            the ball being centred the K.RR's got away but' Reid returned the ball.
                            Great was the excitement that now prevailed (at this stage Mion was
                            injured and had to retire). Both teams were now playing a most
                            determined and very hard game. If anything, the Inniskillingswere having
                            tho best of matters at this stage. The shield holders were playing a
                            fine combination game. It was a treat to watoh the five forwards play so
                            woll considering tho circumstances under which they were placod. It was
                            now wearing up to full'time as Walsh missed the much desired spot by
                            inches. Shortlyafterthereferee's whistle sounded for full time, leaving
                            the Inniskillings winners of one of the most exciting games that ever
