                    <p>Public opinion does not exist in Egypt in the broad sense of the term as
                        understood in Europe or the United States. The only kind of public opinion
                        known here is of a sectional character, which the Government is often
                        justified in neglecting. Sometimes, however, this collective exercise of
                        opinion by a section of the community has to be hearkened to, and the recent
                        withdrawal of the crude and im-mature Pharmacy Regulations in obedience to
                        the opinions of the pharmacists of Cairo and Alexandria is a case in point.
                        But this agità-tion of a comparatively compact body. of
                        technically-qualified individuals should awaken the Government to a
                        recognition of the fact that legislation is a matter of publie importance,
                        and is nota mere question of turning out by the yard a series of enactments,
                        which' might pass muster among mere draftsmen, without having regard to the
                        various in-terests at stake, For example, where legisla-tion has relation to
                        commerce, there whole classes of the oommunity may find themselves
                        injuriously affected. The system now in vogue is to elaborate laws and
                        regulations, affecting all denominations of the population, without allowing
                        the public to discuss these matters until they are made law. Some officials
                        in an administration draw up the provisions and they are, as a matter of
                        course, submitted to the Council of Ministers for the perfunctory assent of
                        that body. It is only when the Journal Officiel appears, which is about as
                        inuch read as is our own London Gazette, that we know that a law has been
                        passed or a regulation made whereby perhaps a whole industry is crippled,
                        andin some cases, it might be, irreparably injured. Agitation, up to the
                        present, has been extremely rare, but in the future the authorities, if they
                        are not more circum- spect, will have to reckon with it as a force which may
                        undermine their prestige. The Pharmacy Regulations are a case in point and
                        will form a well-established precedent. If the. Government had published the
                        draft of the Pharmacy Regulations before sending them to the Mixed Appeal
                        Court, they might have escaped a very humiliating position, which reflects
                        seriously, not alone on the Sanitary Administration more especially, but on
                        this vicious system as a whole.</p>

                <p>o'clock yesterday morning.</p>
                <p>Aly Sadik Hassan Ramadan, a donkey-boy</p>
                <p>of Assouan, was called.</p>
                <p>Examined by Mr. Briscoe :- He was in front</p>
                <p>of the hotel about the time of the departure</p>
                <p>of the express. The defendant came out and</p>
                <p>mounted the donkey. The Sudanese laid hold</p>
                <p>of the bridle and asked for money. When Mr:</p>
                <p>Sleeman mounted the donkey, witness was</p>
                <p>about four yards off. When the Sudanese</p>
                <p>asked for money, Mr. Sleeman drew his</p>
                <p>revolver and shot him. Witness did not see</p>
                <p>any stick in the hands of the Sudanese, but he</p>
                <p>saw the man seize hold of the bridle as soon</p>
                <p>as Mr. Sleeman mounted. When the first shot</p>
                <p>was fired, witness saw the Sudanese lay hold</p>
                <p>of Mr. Sleeman by the waist. and pull him</p>
                <p>off. The witness then ran away. Before the</p>
                <p>shooting began he noticed only the one man,</p>
                <p>who was holding the bridle of the donkey. He</p>
                <p>failed to notice whether any police were about</p>
                <p>before the shooting.</p>
                <p>By Mr. Gottlieb :- He saw absolutely no one</p>
                <p>else except the Sudanese who laid hold of the</p>
                <p>bridle. He did not notice the revolver before</p>
                <p>Mr. Sleeman drew it from his belt. When</p>
                <p>witness was examined at the Markaz he made</p>
                <p>no statement to the effect that Mr. Sleeman</p>
                <p>brandished his revolver before shooting and </p>
                <p>cried "let go" in Arabic. Defendant drew his</p>
                <p>revolver and shot the Sudanese without firing</p>
                <p>first on the ground.</p>
                <p>Madani Shaluk, a donkey-boy at Assouan,</p>
                <p>was the next witness.</p>
                <p>By Mr. Briscoe : - When the defendant</p>
                <p>had mounted the donkey, he turned and saw</p>
                <p>the Sudanese holding the bridle .. "He did not</p>
                <p>notice the others. When the Sudanese laid</p>
                <p>hold of the bridle, defendant twice told the</p>
                <p>Sudanese to leave go. The defendant was</p>
                <p>riding witness's donkey. Mr. Halliday was</p>
                <p>riding Aly Sadik's donkey and it was he who</p>
                <p>cried out twice to the Sudanese to leave go.</p>
                <p>Witness was behind the donkey, while the</p>
                <p>Sudanese was on the left. He did not notice</p>
                <p>that the Sudanese was carrying anything in</p>
                <p>his hand. After the first shot he ran away, so</p>
                <p>could not remember how many shots were fired.</p>
                <p>By Mr. Gottlieb :- Besides the man who</p>
                <p>was shot, no one else laid hold of the bridle.</p>
                <p>Mr. Sleeman never said "let go." It was. his</p>
                <p>companion who said so. Mr. Sleeman did not</p>
                <p>point or flourish his revolver before shooting.</p>
                <p>He simply drew the revolver and fired. There</p>
                <p>were many people about at the time and wit-</p>
                <p>ness did not notice the other Sudanese. The</p>
                <p>local Court was sitting on that day, so the</p>
                <p>street was crowded with people. Whether they</p>
                <p>were carrying sticks or not, he did not notice</p>
                <p>particularly, as the throng of people was great.</p>
                <p>Mohamed Aly Awad, policeman, No. 15587;</p>
                <p>of Assouan, was next called.</p>
                <p>By Mr. Briscoe :- At about 8.30 a.m. on </p>
                <p>the day in question, he was on duty near the</p>
                <p>Court, which is about sixty metres from the</p>
                <p>hotel. He heard the report of shots in front</p>
                <p>of the hotel and he went thither. He saw the</p>
                <p>defendant on the ground and the was held by</p>
                <p>and also was holding the Sudanese. He only</p>
                <p>noticed one Sudanese. There were several</p>
                <p>persons about at that time, about ten metres</p>
                <p>off. He heard three or four shots fired quickly</p>
                <p>one after the other. It only took witness from</p>
                <p>a minute to a minute and a-half to come to the</p>
                <p>spot. Witness was the first policeman to get</p>
                <p>there. The next policeman to arrive was</p>
                <p>Hammam. Khalifa. The wounded Sudanese</p>
                <p>had nothing in his hand, nor did he notice any</p>
                <p>sticks lying about on the ground.</p>
                <p>By Mr. Gottlieb :- The hotel is on the north</p>
                <p>side of the station. He had not passed the</p>
                <p>hotel before the shooting. He could give no</p>
                <p>opinion as to the state of the street in front of</p>
                <p>the hotel prior to the shooting. When Mr.</p>
                <p>Sleeman was arrested and taken to the Markaz</p>
                <p>witness did not know what occurred subse-</p>
                <p>quently. He arrested him and handed him</p>
                <p>over to two other policemen.</p>
                <p>By the Judge :- There are no policemen en</p>
                <p>point duty about, but they pass up and down.</p>
                <p>When he arrived there was no police patrol</p>
                <p>there. The patrol came up afterwards. He</p>
                <p>did not know the Sudanese before. There are</p>
                <p>many Sudanese workmen in Assouan. They</p>
                <p>are often lawless in their conduct. They get</p>
                <p>drunk and make disturbances. They fight</p>
                <p>between themselves, but do not make much </p>
                <p>use of sticks. Witness was not on duty o</p>
                <p>the previous dày.</p>
                <p>Hammam Khalifa, policeman, of Assouan</p>
                <p>was next called.</p>
                <p>By Mr. Gottlieb: When witness arrived</p>
                <p>after the shooting. Mr. Sleeman was being held</p>
                <p>by Gomar and shouting for help. At the</p>
                <p>moment witness did not notice whether Mr</p>
                <p>Sleeman was or was not excited. Witness her</p>
                <p>denied certain statements made by him a</p>
                <p>Cairo in his examination-in-chief. He did no</p>
                <p>remember seeing the Italian barber, Michae</p>
                <p>Conte, at the time. There was a large crow</p>
                <p>of people.</p>
                <p>Mr. Briscoe said he would not call Michae</p>
                <p>Conte, as he could only treat him as a hostile</p>
                <p>witness.</p>
                <p>Counsel for the defence then called on</p>
                <p>Counsel for the Crown to call Mr. Halliday</p>
                <p>and Michael Conte.</p>
                <p>Mr. J. H. Halliday, mining prospector, em-</p>
                <p>ployed by the North Nile Valley Co., was next</p>
                <p>called.</p>
                <p>By Mr. Briscoe :- On the Wednesday, the</p>
                <p>day before the shooting, witness noticed a</p>
                <p>number of Sudanese in the town. He was a</p>
                <p>spectator when the Acting-Moudir gave a</p>
                <p>decision as to the wages of the contract-boys.</p>
                <p>He saw accused with the interpreter and the</p>
                <p>four Sudanese go to the hotel. Witness did</p>
                <p>not join them, as he went to the bar, so did</p>
                <p>not notice what passed. - Witness saw Gomar</p>
                <cb n="4"/>
                <p>on that particular day with a tomabawk. But
                    he would not say that he was armed with any
                    weapon or stick at the particular time in
                    question. A number. of Sudanese were wander-
                    ing about the town, but they were not all
                    employes of the company. This crowd was
                    unusual. Witness thought they had come there
                    to see that their friends got their money. He
                    was under the impression that some police
                    were passing by the hotel.
                    Witness was not staying at the hotel. On
                    Thursday, the day of the shooting, he went to
                    the station at about 8.30 a.m. and met Mr.
                    Sleeman there. Mr. Sleeman asked witness to
                    come back to the hotel with him as he thought
                    there might be a little, trouble.Witness in-
                    tended to leave by that morning's express.
                    Mr. Sleeman gave witness a stick to carry.
                    Both witness and Mr. Sleeman mounted don-
                    keys. When at the door of the hotel, he heard
                    Mr. Sleeman cry out "Let go the donkey."
                    Gomar Said had hold of the left rein of the
                    donkey. There were four Sudanese close to-
                    gether. There was a, crowd of about 25 men
                    on the other side of the street. The street was
                    exceptionally quiet that morning. Witness also
                    told them to let go Mr. Sleeman's donkey.
                    When witness turned round, he saw accused
                    draw his revolver and was sure that he heard
                    Mr. Sleeman again tell the men to say let go.
                    Mr. Sleeman fired one shot on the ground.
                    Gomar had a stick. He had been brandish-
                    ing it about previously and witness took
                    it that he tried to hit Mr. Sleeman. Wit-
                    ness presumed then that either Mr. Slee-
                    man or Gomar would have to go down, as
                    the time was ripe for action. There was a man
                    pulling at Mr. Sleeman from behind. The
                    third shot was fired behind at this man. Mr.
                    Sleeman was twisted at the time on the saddle,
                    as the Sudanese were pulling him in front and
                    behind. Mr. Sleeman rolled on to the ground.
                    Two more men tried to close in, when witness
                    stepped in and prevented them. Rislan and
                    Gohar made lounges at witness with sticks. While this was going on, Mr. Sleeman and two
                    Sudanese were rolling on the ground. In about
                    three minutes the police came and arrested
                    Mr. Sleeman. The Sub-Moudir and a lot of
                    police afterwards came.
                    By Mr. Gottlieb :- On the previous day
                    crowds of Sudanese were about and many in
                    front of the hotel. They carried sticks as usual.
                    The sticks were about 1t-inch in diameter with
                    leather on the end. On both days he saw the
                    axe. On the first day Gomar was carrying it.
                    On the second day he saw the axe carried by
                    some one in the scrimmage during the shoot-
                    ing, but could not say who was carrying it.
                    Immediately before the shooting he saw Gomar
                    holding the donkey's bridle. 'Rislan and Gohar
                    had sticks. About 25 Sudanese and Arabs
                    were about, but they took no part in the
                    scrimmage, but witness could see that those
                    men "were in the know." In witness's own
                    opinion Mr. Sleeman was in serious danger.
                    Witness has worked with natives, all his life
                    and he knows them. If Mr. Sleeman had not
                    fired, he would have had his head split open.
                    After the arrest of Mr. Sleeman, witness
                    followed with the Sub-Moudir and appealed
                    to that official not to let him be bound. Wit-
                    ness had not had a long experience of Sudanese.
                    The Sudanese in question were not tractable
                    in camp, in the same way as the Arabs are:
                    By the Judge :- Before the revolver was
                    pulled out, witness considered that "things
                    were getting very mixed indeed."
                    This statement closed the case for the pro-
                    secution.
                    Mr. Sleeman then gave evidence on his own
                    behalf.
                    The witness Michael Conte, an Italian barber
                    of Assouan,-was called for the defence. The
                    defence also called Mr. Sleeman's interpreter.
                    The evidence of these two witnesses was of
                    little material importance.
                    Dr. Nolan, medico-legal expert of the Parquet
                    of the Ministry of Justice, was next called and
                    gave some interesting and very technical evidence on the subject of the death-dealing
                    powers of nabouts.
                    Counsel for the accused then addressed the
                    jury, his main point being that Mr. Slee-
                    man was justified in his action under the
                    pressure of self-defence.
                    Counsel for the Crown replied, his chief
                    contention being that the circumstances of this
                    case precluded the argument of self-defence
                    from prevailing.
                    The Judge summed up minutely and the
                    jury then retired. After having been absent for
                    the space of one hour, they returned to Court,
                    having been unable to agree as to their ver-
                    dict. The Judge then read further evidence
                    and the jury, withont again retiring to deliber-
                    ate, returned a verdiet of "Not Guilty." The
                    accused was then discharged.</p>

                <head>GREEK FLEET'S VISIT</head><p>A SPLENDID FETE</p><p>The Hellenic community of Alexandria gave
                    a magnificent fete yesterday afternoon in
                    honour of the Commodore and officers of the
                    Greek Squadron, at the New Khedivial Hotel.
                    The gardens of the hotel lend themselves ad-
                    mirably for such a function, and the whole of
                    the ground floor of the hotel was also utilised.
                    The Hellenic community had invited all the
                    leading members of every European colony in
                    Alexandria, and there was a very large and
                    representative gathering present.
                    The fete began at 4 p.m., the guests being
                    received by Mr. Benachi, the president of the
                    Hellenic community, and his wife. Dancing
                    commenced at about 5 o'clock and was carried
                    on in an elaborately arranged open-air ball-
                    room, which had been erected in the gardens.
                    The weather left nothing to be desired, and the
                    climate during the afternoon was delightfully
                    cool and temperate, which made dancing most
                    agreeable. The fete was in every respect a
                    success and was greatly enjoyed by all present.
                    The following is the list of guests invited to
                    the dinner, to be given by the Governor of
                    Alexandria at the Khedivial Club to-night in.

                    Commodore Coundouriotis and a number of
                    officers go up to Cairo to-morrow.
                    The officers will attend a service on Monday
                    morning at St. Nicholas' Church, Cairo.
                    Eight hundred of the sailors from the three
                    ships landed this morning and proceeded to
                    the Antoniades Gardens, where they are being
                    entertained by the Hellenic community to
                    a picnic.
                    As we go to press we learn that the picnic
                    has been postponed owing to one of the sailors
                    having been accidentally drowned this morning
                    in the Mahmoudieh Canal, in the neighbour-
                    hood of the gardens.</p>

                <head>THE PHARMACY AGITATION.</head><p>RECONSTITUTION OF CAIRO ASSOCIATION.</p><p>The pharmacists of Cairo met on Thursday
                    night to reconstitute their association, which
                    had lapsed owing to the fact that none of the
                    members had paid the necessary fees for four
                    years. Only members of the old association
                    who held diplomas were permitted to draw up
                    a constitution for the new body, though the
                    task was not peculiarly difficult as the old
                    statutes were adopted en bloc ..
                    After brief preliminaries the officers of the
                    association .were elected. Dr. Küppers was
                    appbinted president by general consent, and
                    the vice-presidency and the posts of secretary

                    to. Mr. N. Joannovich, Mr. Georgiades, and
                    Mr. Montini, respectively. The remaining

                    Messrs. A. Mandofia, Gamages, Moharrem Bey,

                    Professor Dinkler was unanimously requested
                    to act as honorary president of the association.
                    In discussing the new regulations, Professor
                    Dinkler criticised the action of the Commission
                    appointed to study them with a view to sug-
                    gesting certain modifications. What the com-
                    mittee preposed was tantamount to a new
                    "projet de loi"; would the Sanitary Depart-

                        his Court had been able to recover quite 91%

                        of their own witnesses or misrepresentations,

                        College Laboratories at Khartoum, sends us
                        the following communication :-
                        "I have had my attention called to an
                        article which appeared in your issue of October
                        25 and dealt with the destruction of mosquitoes
                        in Khartoum. I do not know whence you
                        derived your information as the laboratories'
                        report has not yet appeared, but I regret that
                        such an article should have been published. It
                        is not exactly erroneous, but it is misleading,
                        and half-truths are always dangerous. In read-
                        ing it one would think there had only been one
                        variety of mosquito in Khartoum and that one
                        a malaria-carrier. As will be at once apparent
                        from the report when it appears, and a copy of
                        which I have direoted to be sent to you, there
                        were three main genera of mosquitoes in Khar-
                        toum, all of them capable of transmitting disease,
                        but only one of these was an anopheline
                        capable of transmitting the malarial parasite
                        from man to man. Moreover, this mosquito
                        was not the most common of the three and ita
                        breeding places were limited. It is perfectly
                        true that it has disappeared from Khartoum
                        since anti-malarial operations were begun, aa
                        has the "tiger" mosquito, which in the New
                        World transmits the parasite of yellow fever.
                        The' common brown gnat of the tropics,
                        however, still persists, though in greatly reduo-
                        ed numbers. Instead of 50 per cent. of the
                        water collections, wells, pools, garden tanks,
                        etc., being infected, there are now only about
                        3 per cent., and it will not be easy to reduce
                        this figure. I notice you state that steamers
                        are stopped and cleared some distanoe from
                        the town. It is true this plan was adopted but it had to be abandoned. for several reasons.
                        At present the steamers are treated before
                        leaving and during their voyages, and apart
                        from them there is little chance of Khartoum
                        being infected from without, as was the case at
                        Mian-Mir in India, where the operations result-

                    <head>A MYSTERY OF THE NILE</head><p>In Dr. Sven Hedin's reminiscences of Gene-
                        ral Kuropatkin, which appeared in the Times
                        last week, the writer remarks as follows .-
                        "Once when I was dining with General Ku-
                        ropatkin he had as a guest a colonel who had
                        recently returned from Fashoda. After dinner
                        the. latter was to present to the Minister of
                        War two Cossacks, who had exhibited unusual
                        proof of courage and presence of mind by
                        swimming across the Nile on some important
                        errand. Kuropatkin invited me to accompany
                        him to witness the ceremony which was then
                        abouit to take place .. The Cossacks were wait-
                        ing in the vestibule, each wearing the gold
                        medal which he had that day received from
                        the Tsar. The general at once addressed the
                        two men in a short speech, thanking them for
                        the example they had set to their comrades in
                        the army, and then gave to each man as a
                        memento a gold watch in a case and a roll of
                        gold roubles."
                        It would be interesting to know what these
                        Cossacks were doing on the Nile and why
                        their services were so highly valued by the
                        Tsar.</p>
