                <head>CAIRO TRAMS.</head>
                <p>More than once it has been a pleasure to us to acknowledge the efficiency of the
                    services of the Cairo Tramway Company and the evident desire of the management
                    to meet the wishes of the public in every possible manner. We have therefore no
                    hesitation in calling the attention of the manager to the irregularity of the
                    service between the Citadel and the Esbekieh that has for some time past been
                    very noticeable. A correspondent who uses this service daily com- plains that of
                    late, sometimes on two or three mornings in succession, he has had to wait ten
                    minutes or more for a car to find, when one did arrive, that it was not only
                    packed full but was garlanded by a picturesque array of passengers clinging to
                    every available stanchion and handle. Such incidents are not perhaps wholly
                    avoidable. Accidents will happen, as the old adage has it, in the best regulated
                    families, but weare afraid that in many instances the cause of these. delays is
                    to be attributed to the want of tact on the part of the police, who when called
                    upon to deal with a refractory passenger, or to act upon the complaint of some
                    one, proceed to treat the affair in a leisurely manner that is not at all
                    justifiable. If, as occurs from time to time, the police find it necessary to
                    make a more or less extended enquiry, or to require the attendance of a
                    passenger, or one of the company's officials serving with the car, it should be
                    sufficient for them to detain the persons necessary and permit the car to
                    proceed. If it be necessary, in the in<cb/><cb n="4"/>terests of justice or
                    otherwise, to detain the driver or conductor of a car, we see no reason why this
                    should not be done and the place of the man so delayed taken by the
                    corresponding official of the next car to arrive at the spot and making the same
                    journey. In this way all needs would be filled and the sight now to too often
                    seen of a string of four or more cars blocking up the traffic, while a policeman
                    makes a close inquest into some trivial complaint, would not be so common. We
                    cannot but think that if the company would make a suggestion of this kind to the
                    police they would be met in every possible way and the public would profit
                    greatly.</p></div>

                    has been arranged with German and Dutch banks. £45,000,000 will be issued in
                    Germany and the rest at Amsterdam. The greater part of the money is to remain in
                    Germany, and will be used as a guarantee in connection with. orders for numerous
                    warships. (Reuter.)</p>

                    inst., has been issued. The loan is repayable in 1911, and secured on the
                    Customs. (Reuter.)</p>
                <p>ToxIO, November 12. The Minister for Finance states that the Government is not
                    satisfied with the terms of the foreign loan, but the delay in the capture of
                    Port Arthur and the departure of the Baltic Fleet compelled the acceptance of
                    terms less favourable than the first loan. (Reuter.)</p>

                <p>DIVERGENCES OF OPINION.</p>
                <p>FLEET AT DAKAR.</p>
                <p>PARIS, November 12. The Temps states that the Japanese Minister called upon M.
                    Delcassé yesterday with reference to certain points relating to tho observance
                    of neutrality by France. There are grounds for believing that divergences of
                    opinion have arisen. The same, however, must not be over-rated as they will soon
                    be removed, since France has hitherto reconciled her duties as an ally of Russia
                    with those of a neutral Power. Japan, on the other hand, appreciates the
                    uprightness of French intentions in the delicate situation. Explanations are
                    proceeding amicably.</p>
                <p>The above doubtless refers to coaling and other naval facilities which have been
                    given to the Russians by French colonies. (Reuter.)</p>
                <p>PARIS, November 13.</p>
                <p>It is stated that Japan has called the atten- tion of the governments to the
                    maintenance of a striet neutrality with regard to the passage of the Russian

        <note>
            <p>THE HORSHAM ELECTION results, asgiven in this morning's telegrams, are cold comfort
                for the Ante-Chamberlainites. The late member, Mr. Heywood Johnstone, was so well
                known and so popular in the constituency, which he had represented since 1893, that
                it was diffi cult for a new candidate to fill his place in the favours of that
                division of the county, but Lord Turnour has romped in with nearly 800 votes to the
                good.</p>
            <p>A NEW HOSPITAL will shortly very probably be erected in Old Cairo by the Church Mis-
                sionary Society. It will be an extension of the Society's present hospital and will
                be construct- ed specially for the use of women and children. It is to be erected in
                memory of the wife of Dr. Maynard Pain, of the C.M.S. in Old Cairo. That lady, it
                will be remembered, died in Cairo a year ago. It is estimated that nearly £2,400
                will be required and of this sum nearly £1,900 has already been subscribed.</p>
            <p>THE KHEDIVE.</p>
            <p>The Khedive held an "Iftar" on Saturday evening at Abdeen Palace, which was attended
                by a large number of retired high officials.</p>
            <p>His Highness received Commodore Coun douriotis, the Admiral of the Greek Fleet, and
                his commanding officers this morning at Abdeen Palace. They were presented to the
                Khedive by M. Gennadis, Hellenic Diplomatic Agent and Consul-General at Cairo.</p>
            <p>MENA HOUSE COACH UPSET. An accident that might have been very serious happened to the
                Mena House coach yesterday morning, about half-a-mile from the bridge. One of the
                horses-a magnificent team recently imported from Hungary-became restive and swerved
                to the left close to the trees, against one of which the coach collided.. Owing to
                the impact the entire coach turned turtle and the four passengers, driver, and groom
                were thrown to the ground. The driver pluckily stuck to his reins and did his utmost
                to avert disaster, and owing to his own cool- ness was thrown rather heavily in
                front of the coach. He was unconscious for a few minutes but was at once rescued
                from the horse by the passengers, who had by this time alighted. The groom crushed
                his foot and was taken to the German Hospital and is little the worse beyond a fow
                contusions.</p>
            <p>A subscription of 10 shillings was collected among the passengers and presented to
                the driver by Mr. Norman Hamilton, who was on the box-seat at the time of the
                accident, and who addressed a few complimentary remarks to the driver, a brave
                Italian, who deserved the utmost credit for his conduct and to whom not the
                slightest blame attached.</p>
            <p>HELOUAN.</p>
            <p>The Grand Hotel Helouan is daily receiving new arrivals. We notice among the visitors
                at this hotel Mr. A. Byddulph Myddelton, Mr. and Mrs. Pettigrew, from London, Mr.

                visitors staying either at the Grand Hotel or at the Hotel des Bains.</p>
            <p>The Bath Establishment of Helouan, under the management of the George Nungovich
                Hotels Company, has been entirely renewed during the last summer. Three more of the
                famous so-called Helouan baths (bath with massage under water) have been added
                during the summer. From now and during the whole season eight European experienced
                masseurs and masseuses from Aix-les-Bains and Harrogate, will be in attendance. A
                new Vichy bath will also be installed at the Bath Establishment, which may be
                visited at any time of the day.</p>
            <p>LETTER TO THE EDITOR. REDUCTION OF GARRISON.</p>
            <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE. Dear Sir, Some time ago I sent you a very
                characteristic comment of the Duke of Wel- lington on the reductions in the Indian
                army which precipitated the Sikh war. I trust you will find space in your columns
                for a selection from the second volume of Lord Dalhousie's Life, which explains
                readily why the great event of 1857 was so very nearly successful. In 1854 Lord
                Dalhousie wrote to Sir Charles Wood:-</p>
            <p>"I cannot believe that the Queen's Government would diminish the compara- tively
                small European force in India without any reference to the Government of the
                country. I wish to say to you emphatically that two European regiments cannot be
                safely withdrawn, especially now. Our Raj is safe from risk, but only while we are
                strong. We positively must not be weaken- ed. I adjure you not to allow us to be
                weakened in European infantry."</p>
            <p>In a subsequent minute he recorded:-"The Government of India has no element of
                national strength on which it can fall back in a country where the entire English
                community is but a handful of scattered strangers."</p>
            <p>History has an unfortunate habit of repeating itself, and I put this quotation before
                those of my countrymen in whose eyes two and two make four and not two two's.</p>
            <p>Yours truly,</p>
            <p>DISQUIETED.</p>

            <p>AN UNFORTUNATE CONTRETEMPS.</p>
            <p>SAILOR DROWNED.</p>
            <p>At eleven o'clock on Saturday morning, while the train containing 750 sailors and
                petty officers from all the ships of the Greek squadron was on the bridge of the
                Mahmou- dieh Canal, going to the Antoniades Garden, one of the sailors of the Hydra,
                by name Spindor Milionis, got out of the train and fell through one of the spaces in
                t the bridege, near Hadra station, and after being severely stun- ned, fell into the
                canal, where he was ultimately drowned. The body of the unfortunate man was not
                found until 6 o'clock in the evening and was then taken to the Greek Hospital for
                identification, etc. The body remained there all night.</p>
            <p>THE FUNERAL.</p>
            <p>At 3 o'clock yesterday afternoon, a small detachment from the ship Hydra, accompanied
                by the band of the vessel, escorted the body of the deceased sailor, which was
                placed on a gun carriage, to the Greek cemetery, followed by a vast concourse of
                people. The burial service was read by the local Bishop, at the chapel of the
                Greek-Orthodox cemetery. The body was then deposited in the grave and three volleys
                were fired by the escort. There were three big wreaths, one from the crew of the
                Hydra, one from the Hellenic community, and one from Mr. Anthony Benachi. The chief
                mourner was represented by Mr. Scotides, the Consul-General. Besides all the
                officers of the ship wo remarked Mr. Michel Sinadino, the personnel of the Greek
                Consulate, the Greek Judge, Mr. G. Zervudachi, Dr. Valasopoulo, Mr. M. S. Salvago,
                Mr. N. Sinadino. Mr. Ant. and Alex. Benachi, Mr. Paraskevas, Mr. E. Minotto, the
                personnel of the Greek Hospital, and many others. The crowd at the cemetery and
                along the roads outside may be estimated at about, 10,000 people. After the
                conclusion of the ceremony, the escort marched back to the ship, headed by the band
                playing a march, and accompanied by a large crowd of people.</p>
            <p>SATURDAY'S PICNIC.</p>
            <p>In spite of the death of the sailor Milionis, which threatened to postpone the
                proceedings, the picnic given in honour of the petty officers and sailors of the
                fleet came off at 12 o'clock on Saturday. Over 750 men sat down to lunch, which was
                provided by Messrs. Walker and Meimarachi, Ltd., of Alexandria, at the Anto- niades
                Garden, on the Mahmoudieh Canal. At another table all the leading members of the
                Hellenic community lunched, amidst the strains of the band of the Greek
                Philharmonic. Society. In the afternoon all the ladies of the</p>
            <p>Hellenic colony here appeared, and the men danced the Greek national dances. The pro-

            <p>THE NEW STEAMSHIP LINE</p>
            <p>The arrival of the S.S. Schleswig at Alexan dria this afternoon inaugurates the new
                Medi terranean service of the North German Lloyd. The Schleswig left Marseilles on
                Wednesday and Naples at noon on Friday. She had 23 passengers on board, of whom 135
                were first and 59 second class. Among the passengers were Prince Aslan d'Abro
                Pagradite, Mr. and Mrs Charles Bayerlé, Mme. Bustros, Prince and Princess Hussein,
                Izzet Pasha and Princese Faika Izzet, Baron and Baronne Menasce Tueni Bey, Mr.
                Michael Sursock, Comte and Comtesse de Serionne, Mme. C. Salvago Boghos Pasha Nubar,
                and Mrs. G. B. Alderson</p>
            <p>NEW ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY.</p>
            <p>A new society has been successfully started in Paris under most distinguished
                auspices, in imitation of the Egypt, Palestine, and Cretan Exploration Funds. It is
                entitled "La Société Française de Fouilles Archéolo- giques." The first grant of
                funds will almost certainly be apportioned to M. Gayet to</p>
            <p>assist him in further excavations at Antinoe.. As evidence of the "entente cordiale,"
                the committee are desirous of having British mem- bers, and our correspondent Mr.
                Offord is the first such elected. The president is M. Babelon of the "Cabinet des
                Medailles." The annual subscription, which entitles members to the publications, is
                20 francs.</p>
            <p>ABBAS HELMY THEATRE.</p>
            <p>This theatre was again crowded on Saturday evening, when Verdi's Il Trovatore was
                pro- duced, and it was evident from the rounds of applause bestowed on the artistes
                throughout the evening that the performance fully reached their expectations, and
                was indeed an unqual ified success. Signora Fabbri's Azucena was an interpretation
                of that difficult role the like of which, both from a musical and histrionic point
                of view, it has seldom been our pleasure to hear. As Leonora Signora Popovici scored
                another distinct success. She sang and acted with that grace and skill which always
                cha racterize her performanoes, and with Signora Fabbri, shared in the enthusiastic
                plandits so lavishly bestowed and so richly deserv ed. Both these ladies were
                presented with handsome bouquets. Signor Venerandi was a very acceptable Manrico and
                met with hearty applauso. The famous aria at the end of the third act he was
                compelled to- repeat no less than thrice. The whole of the artistes were recalled
                continually.</p>
            <p>A word of praise is again due to the chorus for the excellent manner in which their
                work is performed, the hidden choruses being parti cularly pleasing. It is hardly
                necessary to say that the orchestra, under the able baton of Sig. Falooni, was, as
                it always is, perfection..</p>
            <p>The performance was under the distinguish- ed patronage and presence of H.B. the Go-
                vernor of Alexandria, who occupied the Khe dive's box, accompanied by the Commodore
                and officers of the Greek Squadron. A large number of Greek naval officers and many
                local hotables were also present in other parts of the house.</p>
            <p>This evening there will be no performance, To-morrow Andrea Chenier will be given,
                with Signa. Popovici in the caste.</p>
            <p>Yesterday's Italian mailboat brought the celebrated singer Signa. Monti-Baldini and
                the tenor Alfredo Torniani, who will shortly make their appearance in Carmen and
                Mignon.</p>
            <p>YACHTING.</p>
            <p>The British turbine yacht Emerald, which is bound for a oruise to the China Seas,
                left Alexandria harbour yesterday evening. The French yacht Fiorentina II. also
                sailed yesterday evening bound in the same direction</p>
            <p>as the Emerald.</p>

            <p>"TARTUPB"</p>
            <p>We had Tartufe, followed by Les Precieuses Ridicules on Thursday night, and the: Open
                House was, quite naturally, full and the audience as enthusiastia as it could be Co
                quelin's Tartufe was of course the perform ance that dwarfed everything else. His
                com mand and control of facial expression were equally amazing. He never underlined,
                and to the British theatre-goer, who is accustomed to over-aeting, that fact alone
                was almost-as astonishing as his historie sense. Tartufe is no modern imposter as
                loquacious as be is underbred, all things to all men and more shamelessly fluent
                than his prospeotas. He is the typical imposter of a dignified epoch-when- the
                lowest villains had a grand air and when honest people were not compelled to career
                through life, at high pressure under pain of being outstripped by their friends,
                and.com sequently had time to look around them and, among other interesting
                subjects, to stady character. We do not say they studied it consciously or as a
                science, but having produe. ed a very distinct and general type of educated man, who
                differed as greatly from the man of the fifteenth century as he differs from the man
                of the nineteenth, they insisted on,the neces dity incumbent on all decent persons
                to be tamped with part at least of the pattern of a peial trademark. Nowadays we
                would not He duped by Tartufo, who would be uni versally cut as a sanctimonious boro
                or as</p>
            <p>consistent eccentride Yet, we seem to remember cases in country towns where ditions
                who were distinguished as "worthy' or Christian men and had even become
                churchwardens, ended their days in gaol or were last heard of in South American
                republics.</p>
            <p>Of the other actors, Mlle Suzanne Devoyod mada a very charming Elvire; but Mlle Boa
                chetal was not very distinct and M. Chabert Damis) overacted.</p>
            <p>After the performance of Tartufe came Les Précieuses Hidicules and a great
                improvement in the other members of the company, who had ot been able to save the
                Alexandrines of Tartufe from monotony only relieved by Co- quelin's splendid
                enunciation and delivery of the long lines. Mllo Devoyod was again good Magdalen,
                but rather failed to bring out the humour of her part, and Mlle Bouchatal as Cathos
                greatly improved on her Doringre. M. Rosenberg, who had made Orgon too much, in our
                opinion, of a buffoon in Tartufe, repeated the Orgonic gestures as Gorgibus.
                Coquetin's rendering of Mascarille's song deserved even more than the applause it
                received.</p>
            <p>"L'ABBE CONSTANTIN."</p>
            <p>On Friday night L'Abbé Constantin made a welcome reappearance in Cairo, and was well
                received.by an appreciative house. The piece is merely a parlour play, and albeit
                light and trifling, rivets the attention of the spectator by its amusing situations
                and dialogue. M. Coquelin again showed himself a master of the quiet method of
                acting, as opposed to the Borid style that involves so much violent gesticulation
                and rushing about the stage;</p>
            <p>trusting to his inimitable variety of a</p>
            <p>trusting to his inimitable variety of expression, he assumed now a look of bland
                innooonce, now a twinkle of arch cynicism, followed by a most suave and affable
                smile to his friends and guests, while his unique powers of artion- lation made even
                his whispers andible all over the house. We liked him best in the third act, though
                in the first his dinner and siosta wore most amusingly rendered. It is a pity that
                the mise-en-scene and the characters call for so little comment, with the exception
                perhaps of Mmo. Suzanne Devoyod and some spirited acting by M. Rosenberg, which met
                with the appreciation it deserved.</p>
            <p>"CYRANO DE BERGERAC."</p>
            <p>Le cour a ses raisons, which opened: Satur- day night's performance, is an amusing
                little curtain-raiser, slight, witty, and well-perform- ed, but we would have given
                anything to hear another act of Cyrano de Bergerac. We had the 3rd and 5th acts with
                Coquelin at his best. The staging of the balcony scene was hopeless ly bad, but the
                fact that the night, on which all depends, was thoroughly illuminated, hade no
                difference whatever to the quality of his performance. Many first-rate actors would
                have faltered before the unreality of the mise-en- scène, but Coquelin carried
                through magnifi cently what is probably his finest performance. If you doubt it foad
                Cyrano and try to imagine. the possibility of such a man in real life. Yet Coquelin
                makes him not only possible but eminently probable and convincing.</p>

            <p>I am glad to place on record that, after my repeated complaints, the Telegraph
                Adminis tration has at last taken steps to improve the service here. A supplementary
                line is now working with Alexandria, and the result is that telegrams are
                transmitted quickly (6 mifiatér for ordinary telegrams in some cases). Im
