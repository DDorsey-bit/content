                        <p>The Egyptian Abroad,</p>
                        <p>At the Guildhall last week, an Egyptian commercial traveller, Alexander
                            Hashin, pleaded guilty to stealing a gold watch from a firm of Regent
                            street jewellers. He was also charged with stealing an overcoat from the
                            billiard room of the Marchester Hotel, Aldersgate street. The manager of
                            this establishment, when the man was caught, administered a thrashing
                            which resulted in Hashin getting two black eyes, braises on the face,
                            and a cut head. Hashin was firat of all committed for trial, but-on his
                            plea of guilty being accepted, was sentenced by Sir Walter Wilkin to
                            four months' imprisonment with hard labour for the theft of the watch.
                            In respect to the goat, the Alderman said that he should have given
                            Hashin an additional four months' had it not been for the punishment
                            wrongly inflicted by the manager of the hotel. He would therefore only
                            give Hashin an additional month, and cautioned the manager as to his
                            conduct in such cases in the future.</p>

                        were disembarked during the forenoon and will be despatched to Cairo by
                        special train this afternoon. The disembarkation of the troops, horses, and
                        guns was watched by an interested crowd on Quay 31.</p>
                    <p>The Inniskillings embarked at Queenstown on the 13th inst., the Cestrian
                        afterwards proceeding to Southampton to embark the Royal Artillery.</p>

                        the British Army, and one of the most historic. It was raised during the
                        Revolution of 1689 amongst the Protestants of Enniskil'en and the North of
                        Ireland for the defence of that town; and since that period its bistory has
                        been that of the Empire. It bears on its standards the honours of
                        "Inniskilling," "Dettingen," "Waterloo," "Balaklava," "Sevastopol," and
                        "3outh Africa, 1899-1902." Its charge in the Union Brigade at Waterloo, and
                        again at Balaklava, were amorgat the finest achievements of modern war. It
                        went through the Boer War, from start to finish, was constantly in the

                        batteries of the "Flying Artillery." It was originally a depot battery, and
                        in 1895 it was converted into a service battery. The battery is one of the
                        two forming the 13th Brigade R.H.A., the other, "T" Battery, being stationed
                        at Umballa, Punjab. U Battery saw a lot of service in the South African War,
                        under the command of Major P. B. Taylor. Its 9-pounders spoke out to some
                        purpose round the kopjes of Paardeberg, and under a heavy shell and rifle
                        fire did splendid work at Driefontein, and again in the capture of the hills
                        round Bloemfontein, they supported the Royal So to Greys. After the
                        occupation of Bloemfontein U Battery was attached to Broadwood's column,
                        which met with a reverse at Sanna's Post. It suffered badly in this actior,
                        being almost wiped out, but was rapidly filled up again, and on the trek.
                        Down to the close it did good service as a battery. At that period a good
                        many of the R. H. A. Batteries were converted in Mounted Rifles for the
                        pursuit of the mobile enemy. After the close of the war, U Battery went
                        home, and was stationed at Manchester, from where it moved to Christ church
                        last year. The officers of the battery are Major and Brevet Lieutenant
                        Colonel H. M. Campbell, commanding; Captain W. R. Elen, D. S. O.,
                        Lieutenants D. J. C. E. Sherlock, W. A. Murray, and V.M.C. Napier.</p>
                    <p>With the arrival of the 6th Inniskilling Dragoons and U Battery R. H. A., the
                        troops in Egypt will number a little over 6,000 of all arins. It is intended
                        to keep them at this strength for some time to come.</p>

                    <p>Dear Sir,-"An Appeal" appeared in your columns dated May 9th over the
                        somewhat cambrous signature of "Motherly love, Relief, and I hope Truth"; it
                        reappeared in a more extended form in your issue of May 21, under the
                        signature of "Brotherly love, Relief and I hope Truth." Your correspondent,
                        who is at the same time, mother and brother to Dr. Albert Edelmann (ths
                        object of the appeal), tells us that the Doctor has been staying with his
                        bi-sexual host for the last two months and adds that he-she has never found
                        the Doctor out in a mistake (in the first letter) nor in a mis-statement (in
                        the second letter) and so hethe believes in him. It would indeed be a orael
                        world if wo were not believed in because we made mistakes. But this is by
                        the way. Dr. Edelmann's mother-brother tells us that he survived a
                        tidal-wave in 1899 and lived to find his way through London to Paris,
                        Palestine, Alexandria and Cairo, where a deeprooted abcess in his leg laid
                        him low in 1901. On his recovery Freemasonry and Mr. Boyle forwarded him at
                        their expense from Cairo to Australia. Here we lose sight of Dr. Edelmann in
                        his mother-brother's letter until his cabaccident in Paris last autumn,
                        after which the Cabdrivers' Association paid his hospital bill and "a
                        society" forwarded him to Egypt. By an esoteric process of reasoning your
                        correspondent qualifies the expression "poor and needy" as applied to Dr.
                        Edelmann because "he has had the grit to travel round the world" at an
                        advanced age and always managed to fall on his fect, excepting, I imagine,
                        in the case of the Paris cab-accident.</p>
                    <p>Let us hope that, in spite of the Doctor's unfortunate choice of an advocate,
                        "those anxious to exercise that great privilege illustrated by the parable
                        of the Samaritan" (was there ever such a phrase !) will contribute
                        generously to the unqualified poverty and neediness of the good
                        Doctor.-Yours faithfully, Cairo, May 23.</p>

                    <p>(H.)</p>
                    <p>Ibsen, the most revolutionary figure in the dramatic world in the latter part
                        of the nineteenth centory, has died at the ripe age of close upon 80. His
                        place in the world's literatare is assured, for at a time when the drama bad
                        sunk to an extraordinary state of degradation, he dared to come forward to
                        show an astonished world that the supreme gift of the dramatist is to
                        produce an impression of life which seems, and which is more real than
                        reality. When the Norwegian dramatist appear ed on the scene and ventured to
                        describe men and women as he saw them with the aid of great dramatio
                        intuition and technical talent, the world, still faithful to an utterly
                        superannuated convention in regard to the drama, was taken aback and
                        endeavoured to crush the advocate of an emancipated drama. He was held up as
                        a heartless ironist and a devil's advocate because he did his best and was
                        successful in the presentation of figures who are dramatically "alive." His
                        fame soon spread throughout Europe, and in England and Germany fierce
                        controversies raged in the latter eighties and early nineties over his
                        plays, which made the innermost fibres of many of his hearers' hearts quiver
                        with a feeling which Sardou and his kind were quite anable to evoke. The
                        traditon of what the drama should be had been so obscured that when Ibsen
                        came forward 's works were branded as "problem" plays, as if the treatment
                        of human problems was a novelty instead of being as old 88 cby-</p>
                    <p>las. Problem was ever at the root of bis work. No drama without confl'ct; no
                        conflict without something to decide. All life wortby the name is a problem;
                        and every play that would reproduce life must be either a problem or a
                        platitade. A pepple that is unconscious of having problems to solve, that
                        has outlived its interest in the interpretation of life, is beginning to be
                        at the end of its inte'lectual resources. Senile decay is as surely
                        indicated in a nation as in a man by a dull acquiescence in the immutability
                        of things; and the literature of a waning race is almost always diverted
                        from the great questions of conduct before it expires in mesthetic
                        trivialities. Hence Ibsen's determination to accept problem as the normal
                        material of the drama, and his understanding of drama as "the presentation
                        in parable of the conflict between man's will and his environment," were a
                        pledge at least of vitality in his ideas, and vitality working itself out as
                        creative philo30- phy is the supreme necessity to the art of the atage. Thus
                        Ibsen's name and fame as the dramatic exponent of life in the latter years
                        of the ninetenth century will live long after Sardou, Scribe, and hoc genus
                        omne have been forgotten.</p>

                    <p>Ibeen was born at Skien, March 20, 1828. He was of German descent on his
                        mother's side, and, spoke German with fluency; but he never wrote anything
                        in that language. He at first studied medicine, but soon abandoned that
                        profession for literatore. Under the pseudonym of Brynjolf Bjarme he
                        pablished in 1850 "Caitlina" (Catiline), a drama in three acts. In the

                        and in 1857 want to Christiania as director of the Norske Theatre. The
                        following are the dates of his best-known productions: "Brandt," 1866; "Peer
                        Gynt," 1867; "De Unges Forbund," 1869; "Keiser og Galileeer," 1875; and a
                        volume of poems, "Lyriske Digte," 1871. "The Pillars of Society," 1877,
                        contains, perhaps, the best embodiment of his social philosophy. Other works
                        of his are "Ghost"," 18-1; "A Social Enemy," 1382; "The Wild Dack," 1884;
                        "Rosmersi holm," "The Master Builder," 1892; "Little Eyolf," 1894; "John
                        Gabriel Borkman," 1897, "Love's Comedy," 1900. et.. Ibsen of late years had
                        been the object of a devout oaltas in England, Many of his plays have been
                        translated into English, and his play "Nora o: the Doll's Honse," was
                        produced in 1887 at the Novelty Theatre and again in 1889 at the Olympic,
                        with Miss Achurch in the leading part. Originally published in 1880, it is a
                        pronouncement in dramatic form on much that is now involved in the then
                        so-called "New Woman" question. In Febuary, 1891, "Rosmersholm," "Ghosts,"
                        and 'Hedda Gabler," were produced at the Vaadeville in English, and early in
                        1893 two series of performances of a translation of "The Master Builder"
                        were given by Miss Robins. Ibsen plays were for a time the rage, and, "Hedda
                        Gabler," "Rosmersholm," parts of "Brandt," and "The Enemy of the People,"
                        were produced at varions London Theatres. They still are frequently
                        performed in England although of late years Ibsen bad grown to appear rather
                        "old fashioned" since the sudden apotheosis of our dramatic'Whistler,

                    <p>3. d'une lettre da 14 Mai 1906 de S.B. le Ministre de l'Intérieur informant
                        qu'en l'absence en congé de Mr. Williams, l'Inspecteur da 3me Cercle
                        d'Irrigation, Mr. Adamson, Inspecteur intérimaire, le remplacera comme
                        membre de la Commission.</p>
                    <p>Mention est ensuite donnée de l'envoi à/ tous les membres de l'état
                        précédemment demandé des décisions prises par la Commission dans les cinq
                        dernières années et des saites qui y ont été données.</p>
                    <p>L'ordre du joar appelle la question de la construction d'une jetée au Port
                        Est demandée par M. W. O. Joseph.</p>
                    <p>Cette question avait fait l'objet d'études entreprises tant par la Délégation
                        que par les Comités réunis des Finances et des Travaux Pablic.</p>
                    <p>Le procès verbal relatant l'opinion définitive de ces deux Comités, avait été
                        communiqué préalablement aux membres, et il conclut à l'octroi d'an droit
                        exolasif pour la construction d'ane jetée et de bains an Port Est, dans la
                        zone comprise entre Silsiley et Kail Bey, ce dernier point étant cependant
                        exclu. La concession serait accordée pour 50 ans, après lesquels la jetée et
                        les bains feraient retour à la ville; la Municipalité aurait une
                        participation dans les bénéfices à raison de 50 % après paiement d'on
                        dividende de 8% cumulatif aux aotionnaires. La ville serait représentée au
                        sein da Conseil d'administration; l'exécution serait surveillée par la
                        Municipalité; an délai d'option de six mois serait donné pour la formation
                        de la Société; les travaux devraient être achevés deux ans après la
                        signatare da contrat; les frais d'entretien seraient à la charge du con-
                        cessionnaire; il serait tenn, dans la zone concédée, à constraire des bains
                        à prix réduit pour les pauvres, bains qu'il devra avoir construit au
                        commencement de 1907 pour être utilisés dès l'été de la dite année.</p>
                    <p>Une discussion s'engage au sujet de cette question, à la suite de laquelle,
                        la Commission par onze voix accepte les conclusions du rapport des Comités
                        des Travaux Publics et finances réunis et accorde la concession de la
                        construction énumérée au dit rapport, mais, en y ajoutant une clause
                        permettant à la Municipalité le rachat de cette soncession à tont moment sur
                        les bases à étudier par la Déléga tion et des Comités des Finances et
                        travaux publics réunis.</p>
                    <p>Abani Bey trouye qu'il aurait fallu dans la votation trancher tout d'abord la
                        question da monopole laquelle est primordiale et ensuite</p>
                    <p>voter sur les détails de la concession, an cas où elle serait accordée. Il
