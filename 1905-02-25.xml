                        country might be proud, and upon whose judgment the public has been in the
                        habit of placing absolute and unquestioning reliance. To the initiative and
                        capacity of this department we owe the conception and accomplishment of one
                        of the grandest engineering feats which the modern world has witnessed. But
                        it may reasonably be asked whether the preservation of the river's depth at
                        its normal and requisite level, the maintenance of its banks in an efficient
                        state of repair, and the counteracting of its dangerous and impeding
                        currents between Assouan and Alexandria, is not a duty which, though far
                        more modest and less imposing than the erection of dams and reservoirs, is
                        equally essential of fulfilment Can it be that we have been sleeping the
                        sleep of the seven sleepers all this while, only to be rudely awakened by
                        the clarion tones of Sir William's perturbing though timely warning? Has the
                        idol that we have so long venerated nothing but feet of clay, which his
                        well-directed blows have shattered to atoms? Englishmen, to whatever class
                        they belong, are, as a rule, slow to condemn. Their inborn and unquenchable
                        love of justice and fair-play operates as an effective curb upon their
                        impulses. Their strong sense of gratitude likewise makes them prone to look
                        with leniency upon the shortcomings of those who have rendered faithful
                        service to the public. It is, on the other hand, hard to believe that Sir
                        William Preece has been guilty of mere wanton fault finding, and it is still
                        harder to conceive that he should allow himself to give utterance to a hasty
                        censure. Regard for his own professional reputation would, presumably, have
                        restrained him from hazarding opinions formed without a due and accurate
                        knowledge of all the facts. Taking all these circumstances into account, it
                        is but natural that his strictures should hate evoked a feeling of anxiety.
                        Nothing will allay the uneasiness of the public but a clear and conclusive
                        refutation of his charges of neglect, pronounced by experts of equal
                        eminence and independence, and to this end a committee of investigation
                        should be forthwith appointed whose standing and impartiality could not
                        reasonably be challenged.</p>

                        <p>We are authorised by the Postmaster-General to con tradict the statement
                            made by a Cairo newspaper to the effect that some irregularities had
                            been discovered at the Cairo Post Office in regard to the theft of
                            stamps from envelopes. The person, who has been found to have
                            perpetrated these thefts, is not an official in the Postal
                            Administration, but a public letter-writer whose station is in front of
                            the Abbassieh barracks. Thanks to the Post Office officials, who
                            detected the fraud, the man has been arrested.. Whenever the
                            letter-writer was entrusted with letters to post, which in the course of
                            his duties was of frequent occurrence, he used to steal the stamps and
                            'destroy the letters. Many complaints have been made to the G.P.O. on
                            the subject and great inconvenience has resulted trom this form of
                            pilfering.</p>

                            night, before a very large au dience. The chair was taken by the Rev. H.
                            P. Reid. Miss MunGavin charmed her audience with her pretty songs: her
                            rendering of "Sing me to sleep" left nothing to be desired.
                            Mr.Sarjeant's songs were well chosen and richly deserved the encores he
                            received; he aleo played a pianoforte solo, "The Festal March," which
                            did great credit to the composer, his sister (M. A Dandridge) Mr.
                            Purvis's songs were uproar iously encored, and the deep bass voice of
                            Mr. P. Smith was much admired. The Rev. Wormell contributed to the
                            programme by singing and playing a banjo solo, and Mr. Manning also
                            played a banjo selection accom panied by Mr. Wood. Mrs. Roberts' singing
                            and her accompaniment of most of the songs were greatly appreciated. The
                            singing of a duet by Miss MunGavin and Mrs. Roberts brought to a close a

                        obvious at all the race meetings, the second day of the K.S.C.'s Third
                        Winter Meeting was a decided success. There was a large number of visitors
                        and residents present, among them H.R.H. Prince Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden
                        and Norway, Mr. M. de C. Findlay, C.M.G., Sir Ernest Cassel, Azzet Pasha,

                        the end of the</p>
                    <p>races.</p>
                    <p>The racing was decidedly interesting. The first and second races gave the
                        best finishes, but the fourth was perhaps the most impor tant of the day,
                        terminating in a good win for Farban II. The struggle for third place was
                        desperately close, Kashid and Roi de l'Air being very little behind Moofid.
                        In the sixth race Latiff added another to his long list of victories, Saber,
                        who was fancied for a place,, failing to stay against London, while Plevna,
                        carrying lowest weight, was a rather unexpected second. The Steeplechase was
                        spoiled by the small field, only three horses running, of which Soudfi was a

                    <byline>(FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT).</byline>
                    <dateline>Helouan, Friday.</dateline>
                    <p>A very interesting lecture was given to-day at the Tewfik Palace Hotel by the
                        Hon. Auberon Herbert, on curious stones found in the neighbourhood. A large
                        number of visitors were present. Mr. Herbert is evidently an authority on
                        the subject. He showed some very strange figures in stone representing the
                        heads of various people. In some of them the outline of the face and
                        headgear of different types of persons could very clearly be traced. Of
                        course, one must have, to a certain extent, an educated eye to distinguish
                        between the head of a fighting man and that of a holy man. Some of the
                        stones were very strongly marked, whilst others required a great deal of
                        imagination to make anything out of them. Mr. Herbert, who is no doubt a
                        most able speaker, made the subject very attractive. One could have listened
                        to him for a much longer time. However, we hope this will not be the last
                        time we shall have the pleasure of hearing him and seeing more of his
                        curious specimens.</p>

                        parts of the opera with storms of applause. Signore Bellincioni and Svicher

                    <p>The Anglo-American Company's beautiful hotel at Assouan has been crowded with
                        distinguished visitors throughout the season; indeed, never before has the
                        hotel been so fall. Among the prominent visitors at present there are the
                        Earl and Countess Howe, Lady Sarah Wilson, Mrs. Cassel, Sir Edward and Lady
                        Colebrooke, Hon. J. Ward, Sir Gerald Fitzgerald, Hon. W. G. Calthorpe, Hon.

                    <p>Lady Howe has been improving greatly in health since her arrival in Egypt,
                        and her stay at Assouan is doing her an immense amount of good. As most of
                        us know, she was Lady Georgina Spencer-Churchill, and is an aunt of the
                        present Duke of Marlborough. For many years she was known in London as Lady
                        "Georgie" Curzon, and has been one of the most notable figures of the waning
                        years of the nineteenth century. In the strictest sense of the word, Lady
                        Howe did "yeoman" service during the South African war, by means of her
                        strenuous exertions in equipping and sending out field hospitals for the use
                        of the Imperial Yeomanry. Then, before her illness of last summer, she was
                        one of the best riders and most wonderful "whips" in England, and used often
                        to be seen tooling her four-in-hand in the park or at Hurlingham. And since
                        her husband's accession to the earldom Lady Howe has been one of the
                        smartest of London hostesses. Both she and her sister, Lady Sarah Wilson,
                        are personal friends of King Edward, and she has entertained him many times
                        in London and in the country. On one occasion, when the King and Queen were
                        dining with her at Curzon House, she executed a tour de force in the way of
                        floral decoration. The dining-room was decorated with Gopsall roses for
                        dinner, and at supper, after a small dance, it appeared freshly adorned with
                        pink, ivy-leaved geraniums.</p>

                        immunity in ague in all its forms... Yellow fever, like Ague, has been shown
                        to be communicated only by a mosquito." - Times, 30th, September, 1904.</p>
                    <p>Against this deadly insect science has at last provided us with a protection
                        in the shape of </p>
                    <p>ANTIKITO CREAM (Regd.)</p>
                    <p>This wonderful preparation – which is most delightfully refreshing to use –
                        is the outcome of long laboratory research. During the last five years it
                        has been thoroughly tested in all parts of the world. By its use the fatal
                        mosquito, as well as flies, gnats, and all flying insects, are set at
                        defiance. It is absolutely infallible as a preventive, and is guaranteed to
                        be free from carbolic and other deleterions ingredients. It is neither
                        sticky nor greasy and one application to the exposed parts affords
                        protection for hours. Invaluable for hospital use, and should be in the kit
                        of all expeditions. It is better than Quinine. Protects you from flies</p>
                    <p>ANTIKITO CREAM is manufactured under expert supervision in the Syndicate's
                        own laboratory, and is put up in two sizes. Proprietors:</p>
